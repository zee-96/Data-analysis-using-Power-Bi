## 🏅 Advanced Lab Experience

I have hands-on experience in simulated enterprise environments, including the completion of the comprehensive **AdventureWorks Power BI Lab** on the **Skillable** platform.

This experience validates my proficiency in working with complex, real-world data structures and highlights these key skills:

* **Enterprise Data Modeling:** Successfully loading, cleaning, and modeling complex relational data (mimicking Sales, Product, and Customer dimensions) into an optimized **Star Schema** within Power BI. 

* **Advanced DAX for Business Logic:** Writing and implementing robust **Data Analysis Expressions (DAX)** for Time Intelligence (e.g., Year-over-Year growth, Moving Averages) and critical financial performance metrics.
* **Microsoft Ecosystem Readiness:** Demonstrating direct experience with a dataset and toolset widely used by companies on the Microsoft platform.
