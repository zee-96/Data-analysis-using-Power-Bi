# 🚀 Executive Sales Performance Dashboard (Power BI)

This project showcases my data visualization and business intelligence skills using Power BI. I have built a comprehensive and interactive sales dashboard using the `Sales Dataset.xlsx` to help analyze trends in sales and profitability across categories, years, and countries.

## 💡 Key Skills & Analytical Depth

This project highlights high-value technical competencies sought by recruiters:

### **Data Modeling & DAX**
* **DAX (Time Intelligence):** Developed **DAX measures** for the dual-axis chart to calculate and track **Year-over-Year (YoY)** sales and profit trends (2011–2014).
* **Calculated Metrics:** Created core analytical measures, including **Profit Margin %**, Total Profit (283K), and Total Sales (2M).
* **Data Modeling:** Optimized the data model for performance, enabling effective filtering across multiple dimension tables (Product, Customer, Geography).

### **Visualization & Storytelling**
* **Interactive Design:** Implemented **Slicers and Filters** to allow users to dynamically explore sales data by Country, Year, and Category.
* **KPI Presentation:** Designed clear, immediately legible **KPI cards** to summarize overall financial health.
* **Geospatial Analysis:** Utilized the **Map Visual** to effectively display geographical performance and profit distribution across European countries.

## 🛠️ Data Preparation (Excel Foundation)

The robustness of the Power BI report is built upon a strong foundation of data preparation:

* **Tool:** Microsoft Excel
* **Techniques:** Data cleaning and transformation, use of functions like `VLOOKUP`, `IF`, and `SUMIF`, deduplication, and structuring the data into a clean tabular format ready for Power Query import.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset includes fields such as:

* Product Category and Sub-Category
* Customer Segment
* Country and Region
* Sales and Profit
